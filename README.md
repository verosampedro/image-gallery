## What did the exercise consist of?

It consisted of making a gallery of images (minimum 8, in my case I used 10) that was responsive for these 3 devices: mobile, tablet and desktop. The theme of the gallery was totally free, in my case I chose the video game Elden Ring. 
The gallery is formed by a div "parent" that includes all the elements and their respective div "children" (in this case, 10) that are formed by an image and a description of this in each one. In my case, to set the gallery in the theme of the videogame, I used dark colors (except for the white borders) and a minimalist style, as used in the official website of the game.
